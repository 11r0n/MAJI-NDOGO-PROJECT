# MAJI-NDOGO-PROJECT
Maji Ndogo Farm Management Analysis: Python/SQL analysis of agricultural data examining crop yield, temperature impacts, and optimal growing conditions across elevation zones.
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of farm management data from the Maji Ndogo region. Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, I analyzed agricultural datasets to identify optimal growing conditions and provide data-driven recommendations for crop selection and resource allocation.

## Key Analyses:
- Cleaned and standardized agricultural data (crop yield, rainfall, temperature, pH, pollution)
- Statistical analysis including t-tests comparing crop performance
- Temperature range calculations and elevation-based yield distribution
- Identification of high-pollution areas and optimal pH thresholds
